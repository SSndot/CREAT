# Potent but Stealthy: A Constrained Reinforcement Driven Attack against Sequential Recommendation
### Datasets
The interaction dataset employed in this research was sourced from publicly available repositories *[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ahiLmzU7cGRPXf5qGMqtAChte2eYp9gI)*, and we use the "5-core" datasets as described in our paper.
### Backbone Models
We provide two backbone models, NARM and Bert4Rec, as described in the paper. You can modify the settings in Rec_models.
### Attack Implementation
```
python train.py
```
